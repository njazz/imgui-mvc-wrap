// OVERVIEW:
/* It's a raw and very basic image editor (or better an icon editor) for Dear ImGui in a single .cpp file (well.., compilation unit).
 * It has no dependency other than Dear ImGui.
 *
 * It uses:
 * <stb_image.h> to load all image formats-
 * <stb_image_write.h> to save .png, .tga, .bmp and .jpg formats (.png anf .jpg encoders can be overridden)-
 * <stb_image_resize.h> to resize images (it can be optionally disabled)-
 * Other non-stb plugins can be optionally included (see below).
*/

// USAGE:
/*
1) First of all, before doing any operation with the ImGui::ImageEditor class, you must set its static callbacks:
     ImGui::ImageEditor::SetGenerateOrUpdateTextureCallback(...);   // This will be called only with channels=3 or channels=4
     ImGui::ImageEditor::SetFreeTextureCallback(...);

2a)  // Globally:
     ImGui::ImageEditor imageEditor;
     // In initGL() or similiar:
     if (!imageEditor.loadFromFile("myImage.png")) printf("Loading Failed.\n");
     // In drawGL() or similiar, inside a ImGuiWindow:
     imageEditor.render();
     // In destroyGL() or similiar, to destroy the textures: (*)
     imageEditor.destroy();         // (*) Frees instance textures

2b) //Easier way (that doesn't delete instance textures other than in the destructor):
    // In drawGL() or similiar, inside a ImGuiWindow:
    static ImGui::ImageEditor imageEditor;
    if (!imageEditor.isInited()) if (!imageEditor.loadFromFile("myImage.png")) printf("Loading Failed.\n");
    imageEditor.render();   // makes isInited() return false

3)  // In destroyGL() or similiar
    ImGui::ImageEditor::Destroy(); // Frees shared textures

NOTES:
     -> Steps 1) and 3) are done for you if you use a IMGUI_USE_XXX_BINDING definition of the imgui_addon framework.

     -> (*) Of course the ImageEditor::~ImageEditor() calls destroy(), but it can be too late to destroy the textures.
        Note that you're free to reuse the instance after the destroy() call, but then
        you need to call again: imageEditor.destroy()

 *                                            Since version 0.31, when IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_ENABLE_NON_STB_PLUGINS is defined,
 *                                            it's even possible to disable <stb_image_write.h> completely by defining:
 *                                            IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_NO_STB_IMAGE_WRITE_PLUGIN (if you don't need .tga and .bmp support,
 *                                            and you use other plugins for .png and .jpg). However, since tiny_ico.h needs a png
 *                                            encoder, and it currently supports only <stb_image_write.h>, this is currently possible
 *                                            only if you disable .ico support with IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_NO_TINY_ICO_PLUGIN too.
 *                                            A modification of tiny_ico.h that use the lodePng encoder can be added, if somebody requests it.
 *
 * IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_LOAD_ONLY_SAVABLE_FORMATS - does what it says
 *
 * stb_image definitions can be used too (for example STBI_NO_GIF,etc.), but please make sure that you can load back
 * all the savable image formats.
 *
 * UPDATE: Added ability to load and browse (but not to save) images inside zip folders,
 * when IMGUI_USE_MINIZIP is defined and imguifilesystem is used (this needs linking to zlib).

// Please post bugs here: https://github.com/Flix01/imgui/issues

/* TODO:
 * Fix bugs
 * Add more tooltips
*/

/* CHANGELOG:
 IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_VERSION 0.32
 * Updated stb_image_write.h
 * Now if stb_image_write.h is used to save .png files
 * (that is: IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_ENABLE_NON_STB_PLUGINS is not defined OR IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_NO_LODEPNG_PLUGIN is defined)
 * and ZLIB is used (that is: the program links to -lz and IMGUI_USE_ZLIB OR IMGUI_USE_MINIZIP is defined)
 * than ZLib is used to improve png compression.
 * The result can sometimes be better than lodePng, but I haven't made many tests.
 *
 * NOTE: I think lodePng "could" work with full ZLib too, but it's to tough for me to make it work
 * (considering that in some code paths I can use lodePng to decode pngs too, and that I've already
 * spent a couple of hours without understanding where I can change the encoder settings to
 * override the zlib compression). It's not even clear how much gain (if any) we can get with the replacement.


 IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_VERSION 0.31
 * Updated stb_image.h, stb_image_write.h, stb_image_resize.h. Added lodepng.h/cpp.
 *
 *

 IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_VERSION 0.3
 * Added optional support for the WebP format. Issues:
 * -> In an animated webp, no frame is loaded.
 * -> Saving quality is hardcoded at 80 for RGB and LossLess for RGBA images.
 * -> It's not possible to save a RGB webp image as RGBA, because the webp encoder strips the alpha channel when it's not used.

 IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_VERSION 0.25
 * Changed the license to the default MIT license (it's actually shorter than before)
 * Added a (slow and buggy) normal map filter
 * Added a (even slower and buggier) ambient occlusion / bent normals generator, based on:
 *  (1) https://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?330268-Self-Shadowing-Normal-Maps
 *  (2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1e6o7KlhEM
 *  (3) https://www.gamedev.net/topic/557465-self-shadowing-normal-maps/
 *  (4) https://www.gamedev.net/topic/469124-bent-normals--ambient-occlusion-for-heightmaps/        by lonesock
 *      Bent Normals work on the same images as (1) and (2) almost correctly, but it doesn't on 80% of all the other images I've tried so far.
 *      Ambient Occlusion seems to work always correctly (and that was my main goal actually).
 * When saving as RGB or RGBA from A, put A into RGB channels
 * Now the ET_IMAGE_LOADED event is fired only when an image is loaded/reloaded, not after saving an image (this is what every user expects)
 * Now "undo" removes the "modified flag" when necessary
 * Now the preview image of the Brightness and Constrast dialog has better resolution (max w*h = 256x256, previously 128x128)
 * Previously the file name changed after extracting a selection to a new image (and there was an option to keep the existing name):
 *      now this is no more possible (reason: "Undo" can't remember old file names and restore them).

 IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_VERSION 0.20
 * Added a Gaussian Blur filter
 * Made some collapsable headers closed by default

 IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_VERSION 0.15
 * Now Paste blends the copied image's alpha with the background, or just copies its alpha value (according to the image channels).
 * Removed a hard-coded definition and added an "Optimize RGBA" check button.
 * Now "Save As ALPHA", when called on a RGBA image, should do better what the user expects (= save the alpha channel only if it's meaningful, otherwise save luminance).
 * Basically with this version it should be possible to merge an RGB image with an ALPHA image and split back an RGBA image into an RGB image and an ALPHA image.

 IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_VERSION 0.12
 * Added ability to show/hide the image name panel by pressing key S
 * Added getImageFileName() and getImageFileFileExtension()
 * Added a proper empty ctr
 * Added round pen
 * Added pen in overlay mode (preview is wrong for RGBA images, but I don't care)
 * Added fill in overlay mode (it doesn't seem 100% correct to me, but this is what I got so far). <=== THIS IS PROBABLY BUGGY!

 IMGUIIMAGEEDITOR_VERSION 0.11
 * Added a bunch of booleans in the ImageEditor::ctr()
 * Added some methods to retrieve some image properties
 * Added an optional callback SetImageEditorEventCallback(...)
